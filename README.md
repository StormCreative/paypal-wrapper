# PayPal helper
This is a really simple PayPal helper, that handles the sending and receiving of PayPal payment requests.
The helper is built up of 3 methods:
	- Sending a user to PayPal to login
	- Receiving and retreiving the PayPal request
	- Confirming the PayPal order

## To get started
Within etc/nvp/PayPalNVP.ini - place your API credentials, here you can select whether it is in Sandbox or Live mode.
